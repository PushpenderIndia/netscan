### Why would be need a another Network Scanner when there is netdiscover?

Answer is quite simple, it is because that netdiscover is not OS independent like NetScan and it works on linus only.
This NetScan is purely written in python 3 and hence has no dependencies other that few python modules which can easily installed.

## Main Goal of Developing this tool

There are very few pentesting tools available which are available for windows.
Developing tools in pure python programming enables us to run that script/tool on any system.
Hence I decided to develop a tool completely from scratch which can be used as alternative of netdiscover
